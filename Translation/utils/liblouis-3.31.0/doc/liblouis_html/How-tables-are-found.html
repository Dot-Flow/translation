<p>liblouis knows where to find all the tables that have been distributed
with it. So you can just give a table name such as <code class="code">en-us-g2.ctb</code>
and liblouis will load it. You can also give a table name which
includes a path. If this is the first table in a list, all the tables
in the list must be on the same path. You can specify a path on which
liblouis will look for table names by setting the environment variable
<code class="env">LOUIS_TABLEPATH</code>. This environment variable can contain one or
more paths separated by commas. On receiving a table name liblouis
first checks to see if it can be found on any of these paths. If not,
it then checks to see if it can be found in the current directory, or,
if the first (or only) name in a table list, if it contains a
path name, can be found on that path. If not, it checks to see if it
can be found on the path where the distributed tables have been
installed. If a table has already been loaded and compiled this
path-checking is skipped.
